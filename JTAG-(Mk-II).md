The USB armory Mk II exposes the i.MX6ULZ JTAG interface using 9 test pads.

The following [schematic (PDF)](https://github.com/f-secure-foundry/usbarmory/raw/master/hardware/mark-two/jtag-breakout.pdf) illustrates connection between the pads and a

The following sections help identifying the relevant pads.
