The [usbarmory-debian-base_image](https://github.com/inversepath/usbarmory-debian-base_image) repository details a procedure to manually prepare Debian base images for the USB armory. Alternatively a Buildroot environment is also [available](https://github.com/inversepath/usbarmory/tree/master/software/buildroot) for customization.
