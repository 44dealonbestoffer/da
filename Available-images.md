## USB armory - Available images

None at this time, this section will be soon updated with links to the
available disk images that, when copied on a microSD, allows to boot the USB
armory board.

The alpha board has been successfully tested with a vanilla Debian
installation, Linux kernel with published Freescale patches for the i.MX53 and
a patched version of U-Boot.
