The USB armory has been successfully tested with Debian and Ubuntu installations, using a standard Linux kernel and a minimally patched version of [U-Boot](https://github.com/inversepath/u-boot-usbarmory).

In order to boot the USB armory it is possible to either use a pre-compiled disk image or [manually prepare your own](https://github.com/inversepath/usbarmory/wiki/Preparing-a-bootable-microSD-image).

The following table summarizes the list of available pre-compiled images:

| Author        | OS            | Kernel version | Boot loader     | Date     | Link |
