## Handling information

The USB armory board is intended for use as a development platform for hardware
or software. The board is an open system design, which does not include a
shielded enclosure. This may cause interference to other electrical or
electronic devices in close proximity. In a domestic environment, this product
may cause radio interference in which case the user may be required to take
adequate measures. In addition, this board should not be used near any medical
equipment or RF devices.

The board is sensitive to Electrostatic discharge (ESD). Hold the board only by
its edges. After removing the board from its box, place it on a grounded,
static-free surface.

The board can become hot, like any fan-less design, during continuous high CPU
loads, mind its temperature while handling it.

## Getting started

The USB armory requires a microSD card with a valid operating system to boot.

**IMPORTANT**: please note that the microSD slot is with "hinge" type insertion and **not** a pull-push
slot. In order to open it gently lift the closed metal hinge towards the opposite direction of the little
arrow engraved on it, a small "click" indicates successful opening. Lift the hinge upwards and place the microSD card from the top, once inserted close it by putting the hinge back in position and by lifting it towards the arrow direction.

If you received a pre-imaged microSD card with your USB armory it almost certainly includes [Inverse Path](http://inversepath.com) default image, please see notes and default credentials [here](http://dev.inversepath.com/usbarmory).

The following instructions provide information on preparing a bootable microSD.

While every modern microSD card should be supported, the following
compatibility reference keeps track of successfully tested cards:

* [microSD compatibility](https://github.com/inversepath/usbarmory/wiki/microSD-compatibility)

The microSD card can be manually installed, on a computer using a microSD
reader/write (with or without an adapter depending on the reader type), with
either a pre-existing image or from scratch.

The following page keeps track of pre-made images that are available:

* [Available images](https://github.com/inversepath/usbarmory/wiki/Available-images)

Alternatively the following instructions can be used to manually install a
Linux distribution on the microSD from a Linux computer:
