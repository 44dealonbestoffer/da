#### SAHARAv4 Lite (Cryptographic accelerator)

Quoting the datasheet "SAHARA (symmetric/asymmetric hashing and random accelerator), version 4, is a security coprocessor. It implements symmetric encryption algorithms, (AES, DES, 3DES, RC4 and C2), public key algorithms (RSA and ECC), hashing algorithms (MD5, SHA-1, SHA-224 and SHA-256), and a hardware true random number generator". 

The security co-processor has been tested on modern Linux kernels with the following patches: https://www.mail-archive.com/linux-crypto@vger.kernel.org/msg12451.html

See [Benchmarks](https://github.com/inversepath/usbarmory/wiki/Benchmarks) for usage results.
