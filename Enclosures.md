## Official

The [USB armory](http://inversepath.com/usbarmory) enclosure from [Inverse Path](http://inversepath.com) is a custom 5 pieces design (3 body parts + 2 caps) specifically designed to accommodate and protect the board.

The enclosure can be easily assembled by snapping in three separate body parts, one of which acts as a sliding cover for the microSD card. Two removable caps respectively protect the USB plug and the 5-pin breakout header.

Just like the USB armory, the enclosure manufacturing, including its material, are entirely made in Italy.

The enclosure can be pre-ordered at [Inverse Path](http://inversepath.com/usbarmory).

Preliminary specifications:

* Dimensions:
  * body: 61 x 24 x 9 mm
  * plug cap: 12 x 23 x 7 mm
* Material: NEVIESTER EG83 (PETG)
* Color: transparent

**NOTE**: The 3D printed enclosures in this section have not been tested by Inverse Path for usage with the USB armory, therefore **use them your own risk**. The Polylactic acid (PLA) materials used by desktop 3D printers have different melting temperatures depending on the specific kind, not all PLAs are compatible with the temperature profile of the USB armory on high CPU loads. The use of ABS or Polyamide should lead to more compatible enclosures.
