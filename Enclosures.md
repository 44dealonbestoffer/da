**NOTE**: The 3D printed enclosures in this section have not been tested by Inverse Path for usage with the USB armory, therefore **use them your own risk**. The Polylactic acid (PLA) materials used by desktop 3D printers have different melting temperatures depending on the specific kind, not all PLAs are compatible with the temperature profile of the USB armory on high CPU loads. The use of ABS or Polyamide should lead to more compatible enclosures.

* [Al Jigong Billings](http://makehacklearn.org/) developed a 3D printable case, design files are at [https://github.com/albill/USB-armory-case](https://github.com/albill/USB-armory-case)
