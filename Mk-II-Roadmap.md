The USB armory from [Inverse Path](https://inversepath.com) is an open source
hardware design, implementing a flash drive sized computer.

The USB armory Mk II, the successor to the current Mk I model, is currently
under development.

This page provides information on the development plan and current progress.

## Current progress

The Mk II alpha has been [manufactured](https://twitter.com/AndreaBarisani/status/1133263401826816000)
and it is currently in testing phase.

The porting of Mk I software framework, and integration of Mk II specific
drivers, is underway and mostly completed.

## System-on-Chip

The USB armory Mk II default System-on-Chip (SoC) is planned to be the NXP
i.MX6ULZ, P/N MCIMX6Z0DVM09AB (900 MHz).

An SoC variant using the pin-to-pin compatible i.MX6UL, P/N MCIMX6G3DVM05AB (528
MHz) is planned, for custom orders, to provide additional security features such as OTF DRAM
encryption ([features comparison](https://github.com/inversepath/usbarmory/wiki/Hardware-security-features-(Mk-II))),
with the trade-off of a slower clock rate.

## Security features

See a detailed description [here](https://github.com/inversepath/usbarmory/wiki/Hardware-security-features-(Mk-II)).

## Communication interfaces

### USB

The USB armory Mk II features Type-C USB ports, a Type-A variant will be
available to OEM customers upon request.

Using Type-C USB allows us to have a plug for traditional USB based
[host communication](https://github.com/inversepath/usbarmory/wiki/Host-communication)
along with an integrated receptacle to act as a host (or device), without requiring a
[host adapter](https://github.com/inversepath/usbarmory/wiki/Host-adapter).

The USB Type-C current mode allows to ensure that adequate current is
requested on the plug side, to enable connection of additional devices on the
socket side.

This design enables new use cases for the USB armory Mk II, which
can act as a USB firewall without the need of additional hardware as well as being
natively expanded with USB peripherals (e.g. drive, network adapters).

Additionally the integrated receptacle also allows its role to be changed to
device, easing scenarios such as controlled USB fuzzing from one side and
interactive console/control on the other.

### Bluetooth

The Mk II includes a [u-blox ANNA-B112](https://www.u-blox.com/en/product/anna-b112-module)
Bluetooth module for out-of-band (in relation to USB interfaces) interaction
with a wireless client (e.g. mobile application).

The addition of a Bluetooth module opens up a variety of new use cases for the
USB armory Mk II, greatly enhancing its security applications in terms of
authentication, isolation and limiting trust towards the host.

## Storage media

Apart from the traditional microSD slot (now with a push/pull mechanism) the
USB armory Mk II includs an eMMC flash memory on the board.

This allows easier provisioning procedures, factory pre-imaging without the
burden of microSD card installation and enables additional security features.

Additionally a slide switch allows selection of the boot mode (microSD vs
eMMC), supporting easy selection of boot media for dual boot purposes (e.g.
full Linux OS vs [INTERLOCK](https://github.com/inversepath/interlock)
protected image).

## Software

A Linux kernel driver for the CAAM (i.MX6UL), which takes advantage of the
OTPMK released by the SNVS, is available at
[https://github.com/inversepath/caam-keyblob](https://github.com/inversepath/caam-keyblob).

The [INTERLOCK](https://github.com/inversepath/interlock) file encryption
front-end supports the CAAM through this driver.

A Linux kernel driver for the DCP (i.MX6ULZ), which takes advantage of the
OTPMK released by the SNVS, is available at
[https://github.com/inversepath/mxs-dcp](https://github.com/inversepath/mxs-dcp).

The [crucible](https://github.com/inversepath/crucible) tool provides user
space support for reading, and writing, One-Time-Programmable (OTP) fuses.

The following procedures/software are available:

* [Secure boot](https://github.com/inversepath/usbarmory/wiki/Secure-boot-(Mk-II))
* [Embedded INTERLOCK distribution](https://github.com/inversepath/usbarmory/blob/master/software/buildroot/README-INTERLOCK-mark-two.md)

## Accessory mode

USB Type-C allows a 'debug accessory mode' to route analog/debug signals over
its connector, the USB armory Mk II leverages on this to break out UART, SPI,
IÂ²C, GPIOs.

A dedicated [debug accessory board](https://github.com/inversepath/usbarmory/tree/master/hardware/mark-two-debug-accessory)
allows access to UART and GPIO signals through USB, without requiring probes,
through an FTDI FT4232H. This allows, for example, accessing the USB armory Mk
II serial console without wires or probes, natively using only USB cables.
