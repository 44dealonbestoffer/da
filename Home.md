Welcome to the USB armory wiki.

The USB armory from [Inverse Path](https://inversepath.com) is an open source
hardware design, implementing a flash drive sized computer.

For a project introduction and information about purchasing an USB armory board
please see information at the [USB armory project page](https://inversepath.com/usbarmory).
