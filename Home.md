Welcome to the USB armory wiki.

The USB armory from [Inverse Path](http://inversepath.com) is an open source
hardware design, implementing a flash drive sized computer.

For a project introduction and information about purchasing an USB armory board
please see information at the [USB armory project page](http://inversepath.com/usbarmory). The following page provides useful information on how to [get started](https://github.com/inversepath/usbarmory/wiki/Starting).
